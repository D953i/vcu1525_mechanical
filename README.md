# Xilinx VCU1525 board.
3D models and drawings of Xilinx VCU1525 board (both Active and Passive versions), heatsink and other hardware.

Work in progress!<br>
Most of dimensions manually measured and entered, may contain erros and typos - so for reference only!<br>
I plan to machine/3d print and verify models at some point.<br>

# Status: 
 - PCB outline and hole locations taken from Xilinx VCU1525 drawing and accurate.
 - 3D model of PCBA (PCB assembly) complete and pretty accurate.
 - Heatsink model complete.
 - Top heat spreader - done only for BCU. Work in progress.
 - Bottom heat spreader - done only for VCU active. Work in progress.
